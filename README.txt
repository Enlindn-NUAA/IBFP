Interpretable Bike Flow Prediction(IBFP)
1. Our impletement of the model is based on Python 3.5.
2. The code entry is the IBFP.py. 
3. The preprocessing programs for 'DiDi HaiKou' are also include in /IBFPforDidi/pre-process.
   The preprocessing code entry is the /IBFPforDidi/pre-process/pre_process.py. 
   You can apply for the 'DiDi HaiKou' dataset at https://outreach.didichuxing.com/app-vue/HaiKou?id=999

4. For convenience, we also provide the IBFP for DiDi.
   The code entry of the IBFP for DiDi is the /IBFPforDidi/IBFP_Didi.py. 
   Note: you should use the preprocessing programs to form the test datasets, so that you can use the pre-train model for testing.
